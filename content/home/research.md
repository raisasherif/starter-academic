#### Wins and losses in collective actions. 
(with [Biljana Meiske](http://biljanameiske.com/)) [AEA RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7474) 

Global warming, deforestation, destruction of wildlife, etc., all represent problems which require coordination on a global level to be successfully resolved. At the same time, they also have their representation on a smaller scale (e.g. on a local level). We study, using a field experiment, whether the experience of participation in a small-scale collective action affects the willingness to contribute in a related but larger collective action. Particularly, we are interested in the motivational and demotivational effects of having achieved a "small win" or having failed to do so, on scaling-up the collective effort, and the relative magnitude of these effects. Furthermore, we investigate whether success (failure) in the smaller scale collective action has heterogeneous effects on participants with different initial propensity to contribute.

#### Information campaigns, environment norms, and behaviour: Evidence from the field. 
[AEA RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7439) 

Information campaigns that aim to encourage pro-environment activities are a widely popular policy instrument. In addition to closing the information gap related to target behaviours, such interventions can potentially change the beliefs that individuals hold about the appropriateness of these behaviours. This is particularly likely in the context of environment behaviours because of the normative nature of interventions, where a ‘correct’ behaviour is often encouraged. We look at whether individuals respond to information campaigns in the environmental domain because of their informational value or because they expect the campaign to change the social norm around these behaviours, and want to adhere to these new norms. We aim to separately identify these two channels through a ﬁeld experiment.

#### Shame or Spirituality? What Works in Improving Waste Management in Urban India. 
(with Ahana Basistha, [Vishal Narayan](https://www.business.uconn.edu/person/vishal-narayan/), [Nishith Prakash](https://nishithprakash.com/))

Poor urban waste management has severe negative effects on health and economic outcomes. We conduct a randomized control trial among households in the Patna Municipal Corporation in Bihar, India to examine the effects of behavioural interventions on urban waste segregation. We test the impact of combining religious messaging with shame-based intervention on household segregation levels. By targeting the messages to different members of the household, we additionally explore the differences in intervention effectiveness that can potentially arise from tailoring the program to the most relevant decision maker.

#### Is there a Trade-off between Efficiency and Visibility in Pro-environmental Behaviours?
(with [Sven Simon](https://www.tax.mpg.de/en/public_economics/public_economics_people/sven_arne_simon.html))

Individuals frequently engage in pro-environment behaviours that are not necessarily the most efficient in terms of environmental impact per unit of cost incurred. One potential reason for engaging in PEBs of lower efficiency is a preference for visibility. Individuals with a preference for being perceived as green could choose a PEB providing higher visibility over a more efficient but less visible one. We conduct a large-scale online experiment in Germany to examine whether individuals deliberately trade-off between visibility and efficiency in pro-environmental behaviours.
