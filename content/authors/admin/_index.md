I am a Post-doc at the department of Public Economics at the [Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Economics](https://www.tax.mpg.de/en/home.html/). My research tries to bring insights from experimental and behavioural economics to study individual decisions in collective action problems like environmental behaviours or voting.
